# eloquentjs
This repo contains some of my coding answers to exercises from the book Eloquent Javascript. 

This is helping me to consolidate my foundation javascript skills. It gives me another perspective on what good javascript is and the workflow and thought processes behind it.

The object oriented folder contains the "Electronic Life" chapter example code and my answer to the final exercise. I've added the predator object and improved the original Planteater object. I've also changed the original plant object and the size of the map.
The planteater only eats when it's hungry and the world has been made bigger so there is more room for the animals to roam. Once the ecosystem became more complex it required more tweaking of each object's behaviour so the world survived longer.
